# Introduction

Our team Automotive is working on creating a tilt-compensated compass. We will be using a Raspberry Pi with an IMU and two LED displays. We will have to start by configuring our Pi and familiarizing ourselves with the technology. Then, we will read input telling us the direction and degree of rotation and print that into our display. From there, we will implement the factor of tilt with a reading on our other display. 

This project will require extra participation as we only have two members, being Jacob and Cooper. We plan on communicating via Discord and sharing our progress by frequently updating our GitHub Repository. As most of our learning/thinking can be completed remotely, we will have to meet up in order to physically create and test our project.

# Anticipated Technologies
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

Inertial Measurement Units

2 Seven Segment LED Displays

# Method/Approach
We are going for a hands on plan of attack, with lots of research and thought before fully diving in. 

After learning the Pi we will be able to build.

# Estimated Timeline
Week 2 - Pi is up and running (system is good), no major bugs that would prevent Pi exclusively from working

Week 4 - Ensure read/save data from IMU on Pi card (so that all forces are known and we can determine if one part or another is faulty)

Week 6 - Take data and transform it to compass reading/heading

# Anticipated Problems
Raspberry Pi programming and firmware

Library searching for the IMU
